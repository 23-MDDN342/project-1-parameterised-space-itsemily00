### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

"Breathing bricks".
This project is a looping animated wallpaper created with p5js, specially designed as a visually engaging and non-distracting Zoom background. The aesthetic design is heavily influenced by the De Stijl movement and Pier Monderian's artwork, focusing on creating a satisfying and non-distracting looping animation in such art style with simple lines, shapes and colours, the animated elements are intentionally designed to create an subtle and organic "breathing" effect.
