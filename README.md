### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

Initial idea
Mondrian inspired. The lines will grow and extend from points, forming the lines and squares. at the same time maybe, the colours will occur by fliping themselves down? the lines are like strings. then the image tilts and everything collapse, colours slide out of the canvas, the lines are shrink into points. then loop.

Iteration 12/03
Didn't like how my initial idea loops, it was not satisifying enough. 
I will draw the black lines/grids as the background, so instead of having the lines growing from dots, they will stay in the form of lines all the time. The looping part will be the colcours.The colour geometric shapes will slide into the grid instead of "flipping". 

Iteration 13/03
Will cancel the sliding motion. Instead, make the color blocks look like they are "breathing": the color blocks will change in size proportionally (they go large - small - large - small...). 

iteration 17/03
it might look cool if I outline all the color blocks and remove some of the lines.... so when the color blocks are moving they move like colorful bricks...?
