### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

Initial idea
Mondrian inspired. The lines will grow and extend from points, forming the lines and squares. at the same time maybe, the colours will occur by fliping themselves down? the lines are like strings. then the image tilts and everything collapse, colours slide out of the canvas, the lines are shrink into points. then loop.
